Terraform
</div>
Terraform is based on HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language), which is the format *.tf files are written in. It is a declarative language (as opposed to imperative), which means that you describe the desired state you want your infrastructure to be and Terraform will figure out what changes are needed to take it to that point.
